 Yes, I have tried the Bandit overthewire war game a few months back. I have completed till 10th level. It took me some time to learn and get used to the commands since I wasn't
 used to the linux enviroment. At first it was simple, like i used the basic linux commands like cat,ls,file,cd etc. Later I learnt commands like grep,sort,tr,uniq and other commands.
